# Office Network Design – Cisco Packet Tracer

This project demonstrates the design and configuration of a **60-user office network** using Cisco Packet Tracer. It focuses on building a reliable and scalable LAN setup with subnetting, VLANs, routing, and DHCP services.

## 🧩 Objectives
- Design a structured network layout for multiple departments  
- Configure **VLANs** for segmentation and security  
- Set up **static routing** and **DHCP** to automate IP allocation  
- Test connectivity and performance using **ping** and **Wireshark analysis**  

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**  
- **Wireshark** (for packet analysis)  
- **TCP/IP, Subnetting, VLANs, Routing**

## 🚀 Results
- Successful inter-VLAN communication  
- Correct IP distribution via DHCP  
- Verified packet delivery and minimal latency  

## 💡 Key Takeaways
This project strengthened my understanding of **network design, system configuration, and troubleshooting**. It demonstrates practical application of **OSI layer concepts, routing logic, and VLAN management**.
